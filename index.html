	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Hi! My name is Amanda Riegel. I am a sophomore at Pitt majoring in Microbiology with a minor in Chemistry and a certificate in Public Communication of Science and Technology. I hope to use this expensive piece of paper (my diploma) to help me become a lab researcher. I am particularly interested in studying bacteria, which can explain my fear of germs since I first heard about them in kindergarten. I recently started working at the Cooper Lab in Pitt’s Microbiology and Molecular Genetics department, where I am mentoring under a graduate student and lab manager. Unsurprisingly, we’re studying bacteria. Another section down below will go into more detail on this research! Other than being a nerd, I enjoy a few hobbies. I recently got an electric guitar and have been learning how to play some of my favorite songs (one of them being Peach Pit by Peach Pit). It’s been rocky progress so far, but I know that these are the perils of learning a new instrument. Music has been a huge part of my life, as I played clarinet for nine years in school and listen to music all the time. I also love art, both as consumption and production. Although I wish I was better at creating art, I enjoy going to museums and seeing other artists’ work. One of my favorite museums is the Carnegie Museum of Art, right down the street from where I live. Anyways, these were a few things about me. Below are some more things, which include my Twine Game, Research, and Home.</p>

  <h2>Twine Game</h2>
    <p>Outbreak provides a first-person perspective into the process of developing vaccines and the struggles to distribute them. This game highlights the tension between distributing vaccines to save lives versus distributing them to make money. The design of Outbreak tells a story while allowing the player to take several paths to the end, where they are faced with a big decision. At the beginning of the game, the start screen informs the player about an outbreak of a new disease and gives them the choice to help find a cure. If they choose not to help develop the vaccine, the game immediately ends and the character is forced to quarantine. This aspect gives a more realistic feel to the game, affording the player control over if they want to play. If the player chooses to help, they can either take a more isolated or collaborative path to play through. The argument of this game appears at the end after the player successfully finds a cure and subsequently encounters difficulties distributing the vaccine. To administer the medicine, the player must meet with a pharmaceutical company, where they are faced with a big choice. They can choose to make a deal with the money-hungry pharmaceutical company, making a large sum of money while sacrificing their good intentions. The other option is standing up for their values and not making a deal with the company, consequently not being able to distribute the vaccine. This conflict is central to the thesis of the game, demonstrating the clash scientists face between making advancements for the good of humanity and money-driven research.

  <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>As I said in my introduction, I am an undergraduate researcher at the Cooper Laboratory in the Microbiology and Molecular Genetics department at Pitt. This lab’s work focuses on the evolution of pathogens in response to antibiotics and antibiotic treatment failure in clinical settings. More specifically, we are researching efflux pumps in the bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii and their role in antibiotic resistance. This has important implications for the medical field, where these pathogens cause nasty infections and can be resistant to antibiotic treatment. Since I recently started working at the lab, my current role has been to establish a foundational understanding of microbiology lab techniques. These include making nutrient mediums and agar, streak/pour plating, culture incubation and growth, serial dilutions, and competition assays. Additionally, my future project involves pioneering an ethidium bromide efflux assay in Acinetobacter baumannii. Basically, we will stain the cells to visualize the productivity of efflux pump function in each mutated strain of the bacteria. This laboratory experience will provide a strong groundwork for me to pursue my future career in microbiology research!

  <h2>Home</h2>
    <p>Home means two places to me. I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA but moved to Charleston, SC when I was 10 years old. After getting tired of the South Carolina heat and missing home in Pennsylvania, I moved back to go to Pitt. I love Pittsburgh and Charleston both in unique ways, so here are some unique facts about each city.</p>
    <h3>Pittsburgh, PA</h3>
      <p>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is a small city surrounded by three rivers with a population of around 300,000 people. The city is well known for its staggering number of bridges, even adopting the nickname “City of Bridges.” There are 446 bridges in this city, which seems unnecessary, but you’d understand it if you saw the traffic. This is more bridges than in Venice, which is literally built on water. Pittsburgh also has a lot of hills, which I most definitely remember from bumpy rides as a kid. In fact, this city is home to the steepest road in the U.S. (and possibly the world), Canton Avenue. At 37 degrees, this hill is so steep that there is even a bicycle race to see who can make it up the cobblestone road. Here’s one more: Pittsburgh was spelled without its infamous “h” from 1891 to 1911 (must have been weird times).</p>

      <h3> Charleston, SC</h3>
      <p>Charleston, South Carolina is a humid city on the East coast, most recognized for its historical landmarks and tourist destinations. Originally named Charles Town after King Charles II, Charleston crowned its official name in 1783. This area is so historic (and old) that it is home to many of America’s firsts. This includes the country’s first theater (Dock Street Theatre), museum (The Charleston Museum), and municipal college (College of Charleston). Lastly, the famous Pineapple Fountain is one of Charleston’s most recognizable landmarks, the pineapple being a symbol of hospitality.</p>
